# Big Data Banking Analysis Project

A comprehensive big data analytics project focused on banking data analysis using Apache Spark, Hadoop, and machine learning techniques to predict term deposit subscriptions and derive business insights.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end big data processing and analytics on banking data, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with PySpark
- Machine Learning model development for predictive analytics
- Real-time transaction analysis
- Data parallelism implementation
- MapReduce programming examples

## 🎯 Business Objective

Predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic information, account details, and previous marketing campaign interactions. The insights help optimize marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
